How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Both versions show which ones were deleted in red and added in green. It makes it easier to find it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will show you some of the changes made from the previous file, plus since some sites like Dropbox and Google Docs do most of it for you.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The commit doesn't save automatically, but at the same time, Git is used for writing code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think it is so you can see the file history of when it was last edited and who edited it.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log would bring up the commits and git diff would compare the differences between the two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will allow you to compare two commits, then it will show you where an error was introducted so it's easier to fix.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try to use Git to find an error in the code without having to go through the whole thing. It would save a lot of time when it comes to finding a bug on a game or device.
