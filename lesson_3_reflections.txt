When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to create a remote repository in order to assess your project on any kind of device instead of just one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You may only want certain changes to be pulled instead of having Git do them automatically for you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is used to add someone else's repository from Github and it says on Github rather than your local device. A clone is used to add someone else's repository from Github onto your local device. A branch is used to add certain commits to a part of the repository that can then be combined to a master branch. Each branch can be worked on either by one person or multiple people.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally.

  If you were to end up losing the original, the copy would be there in the remote if you need it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  I think the best way to collaborate without using Git or GitHub is to share code through other platforms. I think it would be harder since it would be difficult to find spelling errors and add comments if necessary.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

  I believe it is better to make changes in a separate branch so people can agree on the changes made before they are added to the master branch. They can make changes and agree on them before adding them to the master branch.
