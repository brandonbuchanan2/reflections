When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to create a remote repository in order to assess your project on any kind of device instead of just one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You may only want certain changes to be pulled instead of having Git do them automatically for you.
