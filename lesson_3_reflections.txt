When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to create a remote repository in order to assess your project on any kind of device instead of just one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You may only want certain changes to be pulled instead of having Git do them automatically for you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is used to add someone else's repository from Github and it says on Github rather than your local device. A clone is used to add someone else's repository from Github onto your local device. A branch is used to add certain commits to a part of the repository that can then be combined to a master branch. Each branch can be worked on either by one person or multiple people.
